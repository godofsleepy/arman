  Nike is now selling its first-ever performance hijab for Muslim female athletes. 

On its U.S. shopping website, Nike says the Nike Pro Hijab is made with lightweight, breathable fabric "that wicks away sweat, and stays tucked in during any workout or competition."

"The pull-on design and long back keeps the Hijab in place, while mesh fabric provides a breathable, personalized fit," Nike said. It features tiny, strategically placed holes for "optimal breathability" but is otherwise opaque.

The hijab sells for 35 and is available in black in sizes from extra-small to large.

While most Muslim women wear the hijab for religious reasons as an expression of modesty, other Arab or Muslim women choose to wear it to express cultural identity. 

“It’s not just about making a product available for Muslim and Arab women, but it is also giving a chance to those women who are putting off the idea of wearing the veil completely in order to compete,” Manal Rostom told Al Arabiya English earlier this year.
